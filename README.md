## Introduction
Hello ðŸ‘‹! This is a personal project of mine to (hopefully) help me maintain my efforts in improving myself. 
I started this project because I was inspired by my peers and I took action after skim-reading Atomic Habits for 1.5 hours.

You can read the assessment document to see what I did before starting the development, and you can pick my brain on my decisions 
and thought process. I didn't manage to write down everything since it would get messy, but I hope it's sufficient to see why 
I made my decisions.

Here are some of the major decisions I've made in the application's design that you can also see in the assessment document:
- This project is developed using Native React (TS) and SQLite, for both Android and iOS
- The infrastructure will be managed using Terraform in another repository <!-- TODO add repo link if public / remove this if private -->
- The first phase of development's synchronization feature will just be an upload of the SQLite database. The second phase will require a custom implementation, possibly making use of AWS Lambda
